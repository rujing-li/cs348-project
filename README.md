# cs348-project

CS348 Project is an application designed for sharing the carpool information. The dataset will mainly include the profile of the drivers and passengers as well as the carpool information created by the drivers. (Administrators?). Drivers and passengers will have their own profile and be able to edit it. Drivers can edit the database by inserting their carpool planning by filling out a form. Passengers can search the carpool information by filtering time, Place of departure and Destination.

We are planning to use Javascript for the development of the website and it will mainly be on our local machines. We will use React.js for the front-end and Node.js for the backend. The database we have selected is MySQL. The users will interact with our application via web UI. For instance, all users could register their accounts and login via a online webpage by which then our application could fetch their information and store into our database. The carpool drivers and the passengers will then be directed to another webpage and indicate if they want to start a carpool and find carpools to ride and enter relevant information (FROM location, TO location, approximate time, etc.)
